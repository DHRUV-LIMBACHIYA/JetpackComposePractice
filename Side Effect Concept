What is side effect?
An expression or function which is responsible for updating the global state variable value inside local environment.

var globarVar = "hello"
@Composable
fun updateUi(){
    globarVar = "world" // Side Effect.
}



Why Composable function should be Side Effect free?

Consider the following scenario.

var count = 0 // Global var
@Composable
fun UpdateUI(name: String) {
    count++ // Side Effect. Updating global varible.

    Text(name)
}

UpdateUI() composable will only recompose when there is change in name and it will recompose only Text() composable because Text() composable is depend on “name”. So here count++ expression is skipped during Recomposition and it will not update global “count” variable. And this thing will lead to bug or an unexpected app behavior.

Conclusion : Do not put global state in Composable function because recomposition mechanism can skip that expression or code which is responsible for updating your global state.
